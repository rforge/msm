POSSIBLE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS

Random effects models.  Could be done by translating a msm model to
corresponding JAGS or Stan code, inserting the random effects
then using MCMC for estimation.  HMMs would probably be better in
Stan.

Time-inhomogeneous models with smoothly-varying intensities.  Could be 
done by numerically integrating the Kolmogorov equations, as in Titman
(Biometrics 2011).  deSolve package could be used for this in C, 
but I expect this would need a C function to be written for each model
structure. 

Phase-type models.  Build appropriate parameter constraints in.

Multicore bootstrapping using "parallel" package.  Must work
cross-platform, including Windows.


SOME OTHER SUGGESTIONS: not all may be sensible.

Bureau survival plots

Particle swarm optimisation?  ppso  http://www.rforge.net/ppso/index.html, or hydroPSO

Borrow matrix exponential code from Matrix package: code in dgeMatrix.c

Multiple realisations from same hidden trace, and/or multivariate HMM outcomes (major change to data structures needed). 

For hidden models, cache Pmatrix once for frequently-occurring each from, to, time combinations

Investigate forward algorithm for fitting HMMs - is this more efficient?

Truncated observations. 

.Call for passing data to C?

Steady state probabilities

Use S_alloc instead of Calloc as in Viterbi - no need to free. Can't use on.exit to free on interrupt unless pointer declared globally.

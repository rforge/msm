\description{
  Estimate the expected total length of stay, or the expected number of visits, in each state, for
a given period of evolution of a multi-state model.

\usage{
totlos.msm(x, start=1, end=NULL, fromt=0, tot=Inf, covariates="mean",
           piecewise.times=NULL, piecewise.covariates=NULL,
           num.integ=FALSE, discount=0, env=FALSE,

}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A fitted multi-state model, as returned by
    \code{\link{msm}}. }

  \item{start}{Either a single number giving the state at the beginning
    of the period, or a vector of probabilities of being in each state
    at this time.
  }

  \item{end}{States to estimate the total length of stay (or number of
    visits) in. Defaults to all states.  This is deprecated, since with
    the analytic solution (see "Details") it doesn't save any
    computation to only estimate for a subset of states.}

  \item{fromt}{Time from which to estimate.  Defaults to 0, the beginning of the process.}

  \item{tot}{Time up to which the estimate is made.  Defaults to
    infinity,  giving the expected time spent in or number of visits to
    the state until absorption. However, the calculation will be much
    more efficient if a finite (potentially large) time is specified:
    see the "Details" section.  For models without an absorbing state,
    \code{t} must be specified.}

  \item{covariates}{
    The covariate values to estimate for.  This can either be:\cr

    the string \code{"mean"}, denoting the means of the covariates in
    the data (this is the default),\cr

    the number \code{0}, indicating that all the covariates should be
    set to zero,\cr

    or a list of values, with optional names. For example

    \code{list (60, 1)}

    where the order of the list follows the order of the covariates
    originally given in the model formula, or a named list,

    \code{list (age = 60, sex = 1)}

  }

  \item{piecewise.times}{ Times at which piecewise-constant intensities
    change. See \code{\link{pmatrix.piecewise.msm}} for how to specify
    this. This is only required for time-inhomogeneous models specified
    using explicit time-dependent covariates, and should not be used for
    models specified using "pci".}

  \item{piecewise.covariates}{Covariates on which the piecewise-constant
    intensities depend. See \code{\link{pmatrix.piecewise.msm}} for how to
    specify this.}

  \item{num.integ}{Use numerical integration instead of analytic
    solution (see below).}

  \item{discount}{Discount rate in continuous time.}

  \item{env}{Supplied to \code{\link{totlos.msm}}.
    If \code{TRUE}, return the expected number of visits to
   each state. If \code{FALSE}, return the total length of stay in each
   state. \code{\link{envisits.msm}} simply calls
   \code{\link{totlos.msm}} with \code{env=TRUE}.}

  \item{ci}{If \code{"normal"}, then calculate a confidence interval
    by simulating \code{B} random vectors
    from the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution implied by the
    maximum likelihood estimates (and covariance matrix) of the log
    transition intensities and covariate effects, then calculating the
    total length of stay for each replicate.

    If \code{"bootstrap"} then calculate a confidence interval by
    non-parametric bootstrap refitting.  This is 1-2 orders of magnitude
    slower than the \code{"normal"} method, but is expected to be more
    accurate. See \code{\link{boot.msm}} for more details of
    bootstrapping in \pkg{msm}.

    If \code{"none"} (the default) then no confidence interval is
    calculated.}

  \item{cl}{Width of the symmetric confidence interval, relative to 1}

  \item{B}{Number of bootstrap replicates}

  \item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to the
    \code{\link{integrate}} function to control the numerical
    integration.}
}
\value{
  A vector of expected total lengths of stay (\code{\link{totlos.msm}}),
    or expected number of visits (\code{\link{envisits.msm}}), for each
    transient state.
  }
\details{
  The expected total length of stay in state \eqn{j} between times
  \eqn{t_1} and \eqn{t_2}, from the point of view of an individual in
  state \eqn{i} at time 0, is defined by the integral from \eqn{t_1} to
  \eqn{t_2} of the \eqn{i,j} entry of the transition probability matrix
  \eqn{P(t) = Exp(tQ)}, where \eqn{Q} is the transition intensity
  matrix.

  The corresponding expected number of visits to state \eqn{j} is
\eqn{\sum_{i=j} T_i Q_{i,j}} (excluding the stay in the current state at
time 0).

  More generally, suppose that \eqn{\pi_0}{pi_0}
  is the vector of probabilities of being in each state at time 0,
  supplied in \code{start}, and we want the vector \eqn{\mathbf{x}}{x} giving the expected
  lengths of stay in each state.  The corresponding integral has the
  following solution (van Loan 1978; van Rosmalen et al. 2013)

  \deqn{\mathbf{x} = \left[\begin{array}{ll}1 & \mathbf{0}_K
  \end{array}\right] Exp(t Q') \left[\begin{array}{ll} \mathbf{0}_K\\I_K
  \end{array}\right]}{x = [1, 0_K] Exp(t Q') [0_K, I_K]'}

where
\deqn{Q' = \left[\begin{array}{ll} 0 & \mathbf{\pi}_0\\ \mathbf{0}_K
    & Q - rI_K\end{array}\right]}{Q' = rbind(c(0, pi_0), cbind(0_K, Q - r I_K)),}

  \eqn{\pi_0}{pi_0} is the row vector of initial state probabilities
  supplied in \code{start}, \eqn{\mathbf{0}_K}{0_K} is
  the row vector of K zeros, \eqn{r} is the discount rate, \eqn{I_K}{I_K} is the K x K identity matrix, and
  \eqn{Exp} is the matrix exponential.

  Alternatively, the integrals can be calculated numerically, using the
  \code{\link{integrate}} function.  This may take a long time for
  models with many states where \eqn{P(t)} is expensive to calculate.
  This is required where \code{tot = Inf}, since the package author is
  not aware of any analytic expression for the limit of the above
  formula as \eqn{t} goes to infinity.

  With the argument \code{num.integ=TRUE}, numerical integration is used
  even where the analytic solution is available. This facility is just
  provided for checking results against versions 1.2.4 and earlier, and
  will be removed eventually. Please let the package maintainer know if
  any results are different.

  For a model where the individual has only one place to go from each
  state, and each state is visited only once, for example a progressive
  disease model with no recovery or death, these are equal to the mean
  sojourn time in each state.
  However, consider a three-state health-disease-death model with
  transitions from health to disease, health to death, and disease to
  death, where everybody starts healthy.  In this case the mean sojourn
  time in the disease state will be greater than the expected length of
  stay in the disease state.  This is because the mean sojourn time in a
  state is conditional on entering the state, whereas the
  expected total time diseased is a forecast for a healthy
  individual,  who may die before getting the disease.

  In the above formulae, \eqn{Q} is assumed to be constant over time,
  but the results generalise easily to piecewise-constant intensities.
  This function automatically handles models fitted using the \code{pci}
  option to \code{\link{msm}}. For any other inhomogeneous models, the
  user must specify \code{piecewise.times} and
  \code{piecewise.covariates} arguments to \code{\link{totlos.msm}}.

\title{Developer documentation: model for covariates on misclassification probabilities}
\description{A list representing the model for covariates on misclassification probabilities.}
\value{
  \item{npars}{Number of covariate effect parameters.  This is defined as the
    number of covariates on misclassification (with factors expanded as contrasts) multiplied
    by the number of allowed misclassifications in the model.
  }
  \item{ndpars}{Number of distinct covariate effect parameters, as
    \code{npars}, but after any equality constraints have been applied.}
  \item{ncovs}{Number of covariates on misclassification, with factors
    expanded as contrasts.}
  \item{constr}{List of equality constraints on these covariate effects,
  as supplied in the \code{miscconstraint} argument to \code{\link{msm}}.}
  \item{covlabels}{Names / labels of these covariates in the model
  matrix (see \code{\link{model.matrix.msm}}).}
  \item{inits}{Initial values for these covariate effects, as a vector
  formed from the \code{misccovinits} list supplied to \code{\link{msm}}.}
  \item{covmeans}{Means of these covariates in the data (excluding data
  not required to fit the model, such as observations with missing data
  in other elements or subjects' last observations).  This includes
  means of 0/1 factor contrasts as
  well as continuous covariates (for
  historic reasons, which may not be sensible).}

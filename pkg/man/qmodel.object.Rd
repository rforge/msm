\title{Transition model structure object}
\description{
  A list giving information about the structure of states and allowed
  transitions in a multi-state model, and options for likelihood
  calculation.  Used in internal computations, and returned in a fitted
  \code{\link{msm}} model object.
}
\value{
  \item{nstates}{Number of states}
  \item{iso}{Label for which basic structure the model is isomorphic
    to in the list of structures for which analytic formulae for the
    transition probabilities are implemented in the source file
    \code{src/analyticp.c}.
    This list is given by the internal object \code{msm:::.msm.graphs}
    which is defined and documented in the source file
    \code{R/constants.R}.

    \code{iso} is 0 if the analytic P matrix is not implemented for this
    structure, or if analytic P matrix calculations are disabled using
    \code{use.analyticp=FALSE} in the call to \code{\link{msm}}.
    }
  \item{perm}{Permutation required to convert the base isomorphism into
    the structure of this model. A vector of integers
    whose \eqn{r}th element is the state number in the base
    structure representing state \eqn{r} in the current structure.
  }
  \item{qperm}{Inverse permutation: vector whose \eqn{r}th element
    is the state number in the current structure representing the
    \eqn{r}th state in the base structure.}
  \item{npars}{Number of allowed instantaneous transitions, equal to \code{sum(imatrix)}.}
  \item{imatrix}{Indicator matrix for allowed instantaneous transitions.  This has
    \eqn{(r,s)} entry 1 if the transition from \eqn{r} to
    \eqn{s} is permitted in continuous time, and 0 otherwise.  The
    diagonal entries are arbitrarily set to 0.}
  \item{qmatrix}{Matrix of initial values for the transition
    intensities, supplied as the \code{qmatrix} argument of \code{\link{msm}}.}
  \item{inits}{Vector of these initial values, reading across rows of
    \code{qmatrix} and excluding the diagonal and disallowed transitions.}
  \item{constr}{Indicators for equality constraints on baseline
    intensities, taken from the \code{qconstraint} argument to
    \code{\link{msm}}, and mapped if necessary to the set (1,2,3,...).}
  \item{ndpars}{Number of distinct allowed instantaneous transitions, after applying
    equality constraints.}
  \item{expm}{Use \pkg{expm} package to calculate matrix exponentials
    for likelihoods, as supplied to the \code{use.expm} argument of
    \code{\link{msm}}.  \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.}
